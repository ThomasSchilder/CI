I have held off from going to a Hooters for ever, and wish I went longer. The place was empty on a Saturday night, hint 1. The food on the menu didn't grab me at all so I went with a Philly chicken and waited 30 minutes for a plate of cold fries to go with a Philly which I thought came with fries, only to find out on my bill, that a $15 Philly did not come with fries, and I was charged $2. Will NEVER to another Hooters, ever!!!!", "date": "2014-11-16 08:38:47", "compliment_count": 0}
